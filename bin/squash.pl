#
#  This is the squash version (not the squash-merge version)
#  This version will squash all the commits on your branch into one commit so you can 
#    merge that one commit into the master branch that contains the aggregation of you changes (but in a single commit).
#
#  The way this works:
#     (1) Find the merge base between your feature branch and the other branch (typically master)
#     (2) Create a branch at the merge base
#     (3) Do a merge with a squash from your feature branch into the temporary branch at the merge base.
#         - the result of this is that a temporary branch exists with a single commit relative to the merge base
#     (4) Rename the branches so that the temporary branch replaces your feature branch and the original feature branch is deleted.
#        - this step does comparison checks to ensure that there are no differences between the temporary branch and your feature branch
#
#  SIDE EFFECT... this will replace your branch with an equivalent branch with the same final content but with a single commit.
#      So... you will need to do a force push to the server
#
#  This script / process would typically be done in preparation of a merge (or a Pull Request)
#  
#  This script does not do any rebasing.  There is a similar process / script that effectively does a rebase (without doing a rebase).
#
#
# TO DO - add ability to take in arguments for
#    Add option for -m "<commit messaage to use in squash commit>"
#
#    Maybe... maybe not???:  VVV
#    ability to squash relative to a commit... 
#       so instead of the -b argument, supply a -c ?... 
#       and then you need to make the -b argument not required
#
#
# perl squash.pl -help
# perl squash.pl -b=master
# perl squash.pl -b master
# perl squash.pl -b master -m "<commit msg>"             <----  Commit message is required.

# perl squash.pl -b master -v -m "<commit msg>"
# perl squash.pl -c <commit-sha> -m "<commit msg>"       <---- -c specifies a commit hash of an ancestor.  this will squash all commits on the current branch, down to 
#                                                          but excluding ancestor commit
