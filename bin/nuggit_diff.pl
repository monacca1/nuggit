=head1 SYNOPSIS
   No arguments - get all the differences between the working copy of 
      files and the local repository

 nuggit_diff.pl ../path/to/file.c
   One argument: Argument is a particular file, which may be in a submodule (or not) -
      get the differences of the specified file between the 
      working copy of the file and the local repository

 nuggit_diff.pl ../path/to/dir
   One argument: Argument is a particular directory, which may be in a submodule (or not) -
      get the differences of the specified directory between the 
      working copy of the file and the local repository

 nuggit_diff.pl origin/<branch> <branch>
   two arguments, diff between the two branches

The following options are supported:

=over

=item --color | --no-color

By default, all diff output is shown with ANSI terminal colors (--color).  If this is not desired, for example if saving output to a patch file, specify "--no-color" to disable.

=item --cached

If defined, show changes that have been staged.

=item --strategy ref|branch

Nuggit strategy to use when recursing into submodules.

This applies only when requesting a diff of an object (tag, label, or commit). The default is ref-first.

In ref-first mode, this is equivalent to "git diff --submodule=diff $obj", utilizing Git's native support for translating any submodule reference differences into their constituent changes.

In branch-first mode, this is equivalent to executing "git diff $obj" in the root repository, and recursively for each submodule.  

NOTE: If all branch references are synchronized with their HEAD commits, the results should be equivalent with either strategy.
